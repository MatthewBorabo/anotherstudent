Hello! My name is Matthew Borabo and I am very eager to be in Computer Science & Software Engineering! I am a junior at Del Norte High School and my favorite activity to do in my free time is to play the piano! I’ve played piano since I was around 7 years old (~10 years ago) and I am very involved in Cerificate of Merit, a music program that contains multiple levels of musical knowledge in theory and performance.

## Background
I am currently interested in the field of Computer Science, leading me to take Computer Science and Software Engineering (CSSE). Beforehand, I took Computer Animation 1-2 as a freshmen. Initially, I was thinking of becoming an electrical engineer (or the engineering field) when I was younger but now I am having trouble in picking one of the two fields. Both of these fields both have some math (and science) since I have a deep passion for math, in which I am currently taking Calculus 1.

## My Classes 
 - Period 1 - American Literature (Mr. West)
 - Period 2 - Calculus 1 (Mrs. Hightower)
 - Period 3 - Computer Science and Software Engineering (Mr. Lopez)
 - Period 4 - Learning Strategies (Ms. Parmley)
 - Period 5 - AP Physics C: Mechanics (Mr. Eckman)

## Overall Goal for this Class
 I hope I will be able to get a good grade in this class, no matter how much time that I will have to spend in and out of class. It may be a slow start to learn all about the terminal and basic coding fundamentals, but I will eventually be able to show that I am capable of being a good coder! :D

 My partner is Ian and I’ve known ever since we were in elementary school! His favorite sport is volleyball as it has many dynamics and strategies to the game! He is a sophomore and he plays a variety of video games such as Apex Legends, Valorant, and sometimes Pokemon. He is very friendly and kind, especially when I met him for the first time during my 2nd year of elementary school. I’m glad that he is my teammate for the entire trimester and I hope to know more about him during this course! :D

- Plans, Lists, [Scrum Boards](https://clickup.com/blog/scrum-board/) help you to track key events, show progress and record time.  Effort is a big part of your class grade.  Show plans and time spent!
- [Hacks(Todo)](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/six-ultimate-daily-hacks-for-every-programmer-60f5f10feae) enable you to stay in focus with key requirements of the class.  Each Hack will produce Tangibles.
- Tangibles or [Tangible Artifacts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(software_development)) are things you accumulate as a learner and coder.
